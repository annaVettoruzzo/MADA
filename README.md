**MADA Meta-Learning Automatic Data Augmentation**
Code for the paper "Efficient Few-Shot Human Activity Recognition via Meta-Learning
and Data Augmentation" currently under review.

The proposed approach augments time series data with a range of transformations, each assigned a 
learnable weight, enabling the model to prioritize the most effective augmentations and discard the
irrelevant ones. Throughout the meta-training phase, the model learns to identify an optimal
weighted combination of these transformations, significantly improving the modelâ€™s adaptabil-
ity and generalization to new situations with scarce labeled data. During the meta-test phase,
this knowledge enables the model to efficiently learn from and adapt to a very limited set of
labeled samples from completely new subjects undertaking entirely new activities.
